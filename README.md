# Design Manager

Welcome to the Design Manager! This application is a simple yet powerful tool for browsing, adding, and editing design entries. Built with the modern Vue 3 framework, it leverages vue-router for routing and TypeScript for a more robust codebase. Data persistence is achieved through the use of localStorage, making your data easily retrievable across browser sessions.
